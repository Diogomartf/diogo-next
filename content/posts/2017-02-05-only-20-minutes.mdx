It’s hard to commit to something like writing because it takes a lot of effort and you don’t have confidence neither practice. Both are correlated, I know. So I have to do it if I want to become a better writer.
I’m learning how to take the words out of my head. I feel like I have a lot to say but I’m not confident enough to write about it. I’m falling back to the belief that I must be an expert to have something to say and I’m not. But getting out of my comfort zone it’s what will make me get there. It’s hard but it’s rewarding.

I think most people are not willing to make a sacrifice to get where they want to be. So they come up with excuses to answer why aren’t they doing it.

But reality is that you’re just lying to yourself. Lenin, a revolutionary Russian communist, once said:

> “A lie told often enough becomes the truth.”

And that’s what happens when you start lying to yourself. You start believing in your lies and they become the truth. No more no less.

I remember listening to friends telling me about their ambitions and dreams. And I always questioned them why don't you do it? And they started pitching me their excuses: _"I'm tired", "I work all day", "I don't know where to start."_

I’m a persistent guy so I go on and tell them that they don’t need to start like a pro.
Whatever you want to accomplish in your life you don’t need as much as you think to get started.

Start with 20 minutes a day and increase that time as you feel more comfortable.

Like working out, you shouldn’t start with heavy weights and a lot of sets.
You should start slowly and increase weights as you feel stronger. If you go straight to big weights and hard training, your chances of giving up or getting it wrong are huge.

But the excuses come again, _“20 minutes is not sufficient time to change anything.”_.

So I tell them that 20 minutes do a lot actually.
It will help you start. It will help you commit. It will help you create a habit.
It will put you a step closer on the direction you want.

Plus 20 minutes don’t have much implication on your day.
You don’t have to quit nothing. You don’t need to change nothing.But this 20 minutes will start to change you.

What is your excuse?
