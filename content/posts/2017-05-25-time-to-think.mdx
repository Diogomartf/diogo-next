> The energy of the mind is the essence of life. — Aristotle

Do you know what all great Greek philosophers have in common?

Time to think.

When was the last time that you stopped to think?

Just thinking. No cellphone. No internet. No distractions. Just wondering around about the important questions of ourselves, of our time. Being thoughtful about what you already know and what you are still figuring out. Testing out hypotheses, failing and trying again.

You should do it on a place you feel comfortable, maybe it’s easier to be alone but you could do it socially. You can be static, or you could do it by drawing, talking, representing, whatever sparks your mind. You can think about things that bother you and imagine solutions, or just try to understand the world a little better. Question yourself. Understand things. Find answers.

That’s what philosophy is all about. Philosophy, literally means the _love of wisdom_.

Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.

I think today we live in a fast world. We often forget about how important it is to think without boundaries, wonder about everything.

We prefer excuses to action.

Technology has it fault on this. And we are constantly enforcing the idea that we don’t have time for nothing outside of our routine but they probably include a mix of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

We can’t blame technology, blaming it, will not change anything. But if you do change your habits for better ones, time will be made.

We live in the world that craves fast rewards, fast pleasure and ultimately fast thinking.

**What we often forget is that life is fast.**

We think we know it all because we put a man on the moon. We created the internet. We have all the answers on our pocket. But if we go deeper we don’t know nothing.

We are lacking philosophers in today’s world. Knowledge does not take up space.

Don’t accept status quo, defy it.
