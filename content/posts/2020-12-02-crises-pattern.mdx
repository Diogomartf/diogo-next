We had a financial crises because "we" invented a lie and mask it as truth. The people bought the lie and we got to a point where we coudn't lie anymore. CRISIS.
We had to deal with the lie and suffer the consequences.

A lot of times we mask our worries and we believe in lies. We don't deal with them and everything looks fine, till one day we can't anymore. CRISIS. We had to deal with the lie and suffer the consequences.

It's the same pattern.

Everything we don't deal with, comes to us with the compound interest of each day we ignore it. Ending up having exponentially larger magnitudes.

And how can we deal with this emotional bombs?

There are so many problems that we are in shock. We don't know what to do and the head races.

There isn't other solution than deal with the problems and accept the consequences.
Easy to talk and hard to do.

What I learned is, the longer we postpone the problems the worse. And suffering grows till we accept the consequences.

Finally, from the moment we embrace the reality and act, the suffering starts to decrease and the days start to get more positive.

Being aware is the first step.

We are conscious only when we distinguish truth from lies.

But making a decision and acting is what brings progress to positivity.

Last time I was in a crisis, a friend a mine showed me this quote from Dr.House and
It helped me act.

Some things that help to prevent personal crisis:

- Meditation
- Being on nature
- Writing
- Being alone
- Traveling

This activaties help you bring awereness.
It helps you know what are you worried about. Which is extremely difficult with all the noise in our own lifes.

Than the old school general advice:

- Doing exercise
- Eating clean
- Having sex

This helps with everything.
