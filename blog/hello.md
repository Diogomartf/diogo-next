# Hello MDX

<div style={{color: "red"}}>This should be red</div>
This is the first post I'm writting.

That's exciting.

What I'm thinking about on building this blog is to share my journey as a person.
What I've been thinking.

Might write about my relations, work, overall my life expirience so far.

I'll try to be open about all topics that I have interest in.

The goad is to to make this blog a journal of my curiosity.

Learning in the open as way to get new perspectives, open conversations and getting feedback.

**Here's to the crazy ones. ðŸ¥‚**
