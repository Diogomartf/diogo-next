        I'm Diogo. I'm a portuguese programmer and designer. I‚Äôm currently near
        the beach in Canidelo, Portugal. I recently quit my job to build{" "}

        I'm curious. I'm always interested in something. Be it computers,
        programming, designing or thinking. I like to notice how I think. How I
        behave. Why I do certain things. And how I end up in certain mental
        conditions. Reflecting and acting on this helped me overcome my worst
        times and made space for my best times.

        I really love the freedom to think loosely. My best ideas come when I'm
        not constrained.

        I like to walk. I also enjoy sunny days. Getting vitamin D improves my
        mood. I like to watch the sunset.

        Some of my secret mood boosters are waking up without an alarm and also
        doing a workout.

        My favourite way to socialize is around the fireplace. There are few
        things better than talking while warm, relaxed and amused by the fire. I
        love being around nature. I like to be in the mountains or near the
        river or the sea.

        Work wise, I'm a fan of remote working. It gives more freedom to work,
        and I'm all in on that. In my experience the best work happens outside
        of the work schedule. I believe that small driven teams can accomplish a
        lot. Also that software is eating the world.
